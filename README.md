## Custom Graphic Animation Engine Test for 2d words animation

## Feel free to tweak or rewrite

## What's custom:
All files in the "graphicengine" folder work together to process a series of images in sequence with a single run instance and run in reverse once tapped. Images and parameters are proided by a json file found in the "raw" folder. Images can be found in the /assets/nodpi folder. How the engine is called can be seen in the examples/general/BasicFragment class. I've been working on this for months trying to recreate what I saw in another live wallpaper app. So far the only error I get is with a null pointer exception on the ArrayList and with the method replacePositioning. 


## Should look like this
